			<p> A <b> Muon </b> is an elementary particle similar to an electron but with greater mass. They are formed when cosmic ray protons from the sun
				(particles from the sun) collide with oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere (therefore not muon until in our atmosphere).
				They travel fast (>0.99c) but decay into electron and two neutrons in about 2.2microseconds. </p>
				<p> Muons generated rain down at high speeds, but in time it takes to reach ground (very small because of how fast they are travelling: in micro)
					 some muons would have decayed. </p>
					 <p> Therefore, knowing distance from earth to upper atmosphere, the speeds of muons, and rate of decay, prediction of how many reach earth
						 surface should be accurate.  </p>
			<p> In 1962, experiment conducted to test this. Equipment was set up on the top of a mountain and measured how many muons were present
				in the atmosphere by counting the number that passed through their counters in one hour at altitude of 1910m. Their results were 563 per hour. </p>
			<p> They Travelled down to sea to repeat the count. It should have taken 6.4 micro/nano? seconds to travel the distance from the top of the
				mountain to sea level, meaning most should have decayed. Using Newtonian calcs, only 27 per hour should have been counted, however, 409 were
				counted, as predicted by Einstein’s theory of special relativity, which confirmed his theory.
			To observers, the distance from mountain to top of sea level was 1910m. To muons however, the distance was much shorter-just 183m in the muons 'frame of reference'. This consequence of the theory of special postulate for very high speeds and is called length contraction. Path length contracted from 1910m to 183m as measured in the muon's frame of reference.
			</p>
			<p> The muon's lifetime was also changed. The mean lifetime in the muons’ frame of reference is 2.2microseconds but in the scientist frame of reference it became 23us. So, to scientist, the muons took longer to decay. This too is a consequence o relativity and is known as 'time dilation', dilation meaning to enlarge.
			</p>
		<!-- describe muon problem -->
				<ul>
					<li> The rate of decay of muons in the atmosphere cannot be explained using Newtonian physics.
					</li><li>It was found that predictions using Newtonian theories of the number of muons remaining after traveling a certain distance over a period of time with respect to an observers frame of reference were incorrect. More were found to reach the earths surface than expected.
					</li><li>The experimental data can only be explained when considering the effects of length contraction and time dilation with respect to the muons frame of reference as described by the special theory of relativity.

		<h3> &#10132; Paradoxical Scenarios </h3>
			<div class="super-sub-topic">
				<strong class="cogverb" id="4.1.1L"> Explain <span class="tooltiptext"> 4.1.1L: explain paradoxical scenarios such as the twins’ paradox, flashlights on a train
and the ladder in the barn paradox.</span>  </strong>
			<h4> Flashlight on a Train </h4>
								<P> Imagine an observer sitting on an embankment at the side of a train track.
					A train is the moving frame of reference, and the embankment is the stationary frame.
					In the centre of the train there is a person holding a torch that can sent a pulse of light both towards the forward and back of the train at the same time.
					The front and rear doors open automatically when the pulse reaches them. </p>
					<p> To the person with the torch on the train, both doors will open simultaneously (same time).
					To the person on the embankment, the rear door will open before the front. This is because the stationary observer sees the back door moving forwards to meet the light pulse which the front door moves away from the light pulse, so the light gets to the rear door before it gets to the front door.
					Hence, the opening of the doors may be simultaneous to one observer (on the train) but not simultaneous to another (on the embankment).</p>

								<h4> Twins is Space </h4>
								<p> <img src="phy photos/twin.png" class="left mini" width=30%> Suppose that there is a pair of 25-year-old twins, and one of them takes off in a spaceship travelling at very high speeds to a distant star and back again, while the other twin remains on Earth.
					When the travelling twin returns they have aged differently according to the concept of time dilation.
					The question is: which twin has aged more?
					In the examples below, assume the travelling twin travelled at an average speed of 0.80c for the journey and had aged 30years aboard the spacecraft before returning.
					</p>
					<h6> Scenario 1: Earths FOR </h6>
					<p> According to the Earth twin (the twin who remained on Earth), the travelling twin will have aged less.
					Recall, ‘moving clocks run slow’.  𝑡=50 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠 (calculations used for this t=t<sub>0</sub>).
					Hence, the time elapsed on Earth is 50 years. The twin on Earth would be (25+50)  75 years, and the twin in the ship (25+30) 55 years old.
					</p>

					<h6> Scenario 2: Spaceship FOR </h6>
					<p> Recall that motion is relative, thus from the spaceships reference point it is the Earth that is moving away at high speeds.
Thus, proper time will be measured aboard the ‘moving Earth’ (30 years) and dilated time measured on the ‘stationary ship’ (30 years).
They can’t both be right, so which is it?
</p>
<h6> Resolution </h6>
	<p> The problem is resolved by deciding who is travelling with uniform motion (not accelerating).
The twin on the ship must accelerate at the beginning of the trip and when turning around to return.
Thus, it is the Earth twin who measures ‘proper length’, and the travelling twin measures ‘contracted length’.
As both twins agree on the relative velocity.
The traveling twin would also measure a shorter time (to cover a shorter length) and thus returns to Earth having aged less.
</p>


			<h4> Ladder is Barn </h4>
				<p> <img src="phy photos/barn.png" class="left"> Imagine a barn, 40 m wide, with a door on each end.
A runner has a pole that is exactly as long as the barn (at rest), as shown in the figure to the right.
The plan is for the runner to run into the barn and a farmer inside will close both doors for a brief time to demonstrate that the pole fits.
</P>
<h6> Scenario 1: Barn FOR </h6>
	<p> According to relativity, in the reference frame of the barn (and Earth), the pole is moving and experiences length contraction and gets shorter, so it fits easily inside the barn
At that instant the farmer can shut both doors momentarily.
From the reference point of the barn, both doors close simultaneously.
</p> <h6>
Scenario 2: Pole Reference Point</h6> <p>
From the pole’s frame of reference, it is the barn that is rushing towards it, so the barn suffers length contraction and gets smaller.
The pole is too long for the barn.
There is no way that the farmer can close both doors with the pole inside.
</p>
<h6> Resolution </h6>
<p> This apparent paradox results from the mistaken assumption of absolute simultaneity.
The paradox is resolved when it is considered that in relativity, simultaneity is relative to each observer, making the answer of whether the pole fits inside the barn also relative to each observer.
</p>
<p> From the farmer’s perspective, the pole fits in the barn and both doors close and open simultaneously.
From the pole vaulter’s perspective, the pole won’t fit, and the doors will not close simultaneously.
It will appear that the exit door closes before the entry door as the vaulter’s motion is towards the exit door and light from this door will reach the vaulter before it does from the other door.
<br><br><b> QCCA Hook words for overall response</b>
<ul> <li> length contraction occurs </li>
	<li> Show if given values the length of pole from observers perspective- will fit </li>
	<li> Show if given values the length of the barn from pole perspective- won't fit in </li>
	<Li> This is a paradox (conflicting conclusions) </li>
		<li> Concept of simultaneity required to solve </li>
		<li> Doors are not closed at the same time from pole's perspective </li>

<img src="phy photos/wave-particle.png" class="left" width=25%>
<p> <b>Observation 1:</b> By varying frequency of incident light for a particular metal, there is a frequency below which no photoelectrons are observed. This frequency is called threshold frequency, f<sub>0</sub>, where if f.f0 photoelectrons are emitted.
	if f>f0 the rate at which photoelectrons are produced varies proportionally with intensity, I, while if f< f0 no photoelectrons are emitted no matter how intense the light. The wave model predicated that nay frequency of light, as long as it was intense enough and was shone long enough would liberate photo electrons.
</p> <p>
	<b>	Observation 2: </b>Maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons id dependent on frequency, and not on the intensity of the light. Increasing intensity of light causes an increase in the current because more photons of light mean more electrons liberated(I-interaction) Increasing the intensity of light does not cause a change in the max KE of the photons. Increasing intensity has no effect on the stopping voltage. The wave model predicted a higher intensity light would liberate photoelectrons with higher KE and hence require a greater stopping voltage. </p>
</p>

<h6> Via Black-body radiation curve </h6>

<p> The concept of wave-particle duality means that light can exhibit either wave or particle properties depending on the situation. From the graph showing the luminosity and wavelength of light emitted from a black body, we can see that the experimental data is not consistent
	with the classical model of light which predicts that I is proportional to &lambda; <sup> -4</sup>. Planks suggested a solution to this that electron energy levels are quantised. As particles move from higher energy to lower energy, energy is released as photon. These photon's energies are also quantised (having discrete values)

																					<li> The Bohr Model describes the potential energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom as being quantised. Meaning it can’t have any imaginable energy but can only inhabit certain energy levels that are at fixed distances from the nucleus.
																			</li> <li> Each type of atom has its energy levels at different values due to its unique number of protons in the nucleus.
																			</li> <li> An electron will transition from one energy level to another when a photon of a very specific energy level is either absorbed or emitted.
																			</li> <li> The energy of the photon will correspond to the difference between the two energy levels. ∆𝐸<sub>𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑛</suB>=𝐸<sub>𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑛</sub>
																			</li> <li>From energy of the photon, frequency can be found &lambda; = <sup> hc </sup> &frasl; <sub> E</sub>.
																			</li> <li> From wavelength we find the colour. This unique combination of energy levels gives the specific wavelengths in the hydrogen line spectrum.
																			</li> </ul>

				<h4> Electron + electron <img src="phy photos/electron-electron.png" class="left mini" width="20%"> </h4>
					<p> 	(wave parallel to y-axis). As an electron approaches another electron, they move closer. This is shown by the lines on the left moving closer as time passes. The electrostatic repulsion gets stronger as they approach. At a certain distance they exchange a photon (mediating particle of electrostatic force). This pushes the electrons away from each other.
This photon is considered a ‘virtual’ photon as it only exists as long as the interaction takes place.
After the interaction, the two electrons move away from each other, having changed velocities (magnitude and direction).

						<p> Here you see the use of the 'time reversed ‘arrow for the positron at the bottom left. IT is approaching the electron at the top left and their lines move closer together. At the moment of interaction, they exchange a virtual photon and scatter off each other with just their velocities changed.

					<h5 style="margin-left:8px; font-size:14px;"> 2. Electron-positron annihilation </h5>
					<p><img src="phy photos/electron-positron.png" class="left mini" width="20%"> The electron and positron approach each other.
As they get closer they do something strange.
Rather than scatter, they annihilate each other. Actually, they both form a virtual photon.
Being virtual the photon lives for a very short time but then out of the photon’s energy a new electron-positron pair is created.

</p><br> <br> <br>
				<h4> Neutron decaying into a proton </h4>
					<p> <img src="phy photos/neutron-proton.png" width=60% class="left">TIP: Looks funny. Carbon 14 is unstable and has too many neutrons for number of protons. It can shed some of its excess energy by undergoing beta decay in which one of the neutrons turns into a proton. It uses some of its excess energy to form a virtual intermediate particle called the W-boson that disappears by forming an electron and an electron antineutrino.
