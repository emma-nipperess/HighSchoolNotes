<p>The reason as to why reverse reactions can occur, can be understood by referring to energy profile diagrams
When particles collide, the energy associated with collisions can break bonds in reactant particles, allowing them to rearrange to form new products. The energy required to break reactant bonds in order for the reaction to occur  activation energy
Is the forward reaction endothermic or exothermic? What about the reverse reaction?
Provided that the reaction has enough energy to overcome the activation energy for both the forward and reverse reactions, the reaction proceeds until equilibrium is maintained. </p>

	<br><br>When you add ACID into the solution you will be increasing the number (concentration) of H+ ions. If more H+ is added to this solution it shifts equilibrium to the left, absorbing H+ so the H+ remains unchanged.
	</p><P> When you add a BASE to solution it contain hydroxide ions. They react with H+ decreasing its concentration. If you decrease the hydrogen ion concentration (H+) the equilibrium shifts to the right to compensate for loss of H+ and decrease in ph. </p>
	<p> Consider the previous example: If too much H+ is added, the equilibrium is shifted all the way to the left, and there is no longer more CH3COO to "absorb" H+> At that point the solution no longer resists change in pH; it is useless as a buffer. </p>

              <p> If the Ka value (or Kb value) is large, the concentration of the products of the dissociation equation are high and therefore favoured making it a strong acid.
      <br> <br>
      If the Ka value (or Kb value) is small, then the acid / base does not readily dissociate making it a weak acid.

        <h5> Alcohols </h5>
        <p> The polar -OH in alcohol molecules means that Hydrogen bonding occurs causing higher MP and BP than alkanes of same parent. </P>
          <p> since the degree of branching increase with degree of alcohol, primary has the highest MP and BP and tertiary has the lowest MP and BP. </p>

        <h5> Aldehydes, Ketones and Esters </h5>
        <p> Aldehydes and ketones contain carbonyl (C=O) group. C=O bond is polar and dipole-dipole forces exist between them, making aldehydes and ketones to have <b> Higher </b> BP and MP than alkanes of same parent chain </p>
        <p> Esters contain a carboxylate (R-C=O,-O-R).</p>

        <h5> Carboxylic acids, amines and amides </h5>
        <p> Each of the carboxyl (carboxylic acid), amino (amine) and carboxamide (amide) allow for hydrogen bonding, causing these homologous series to have higher melting and boiling points than alkanes of the same parent. </p>

        <h5> Haloalkanes </h5>
        <p> Presence of the halogen group means that the molecules are polar, and dipole-dipole occur between molecules, causing higher BP and MP than alkane of same parent chain. </p>

        <strong class="cogverb" id="4.1.2B"> Predict<span class="tooltiptext"> 4.1.2B:predict and explain the trends in melting and boiling point for members of a homologous series </span> </strong>
        <p> As carbon number (of hydrocarbon) increase, the molar mass also increases. The chain length gets greater and hence the London (dispersion) forces between molecules increases. More energy required to break intermolecular forces and hence high boiling point.
        </p> <p> Straight chain alkanes are able to fit together more closely resulting in more content with adjacent molecules, and hence more London forces and higher boiling point than branch chain isomers. <b> Straight chains are strong. High BP </b> </p>

        <h4>Solubility </h4>
            <strong class="cogverb" id="4.1.2C"> Discuss <span class="tooltiptext"> 4.1.2C: discuss the volatility and solubility in water of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and halides.</span> </strong>
              <p> Generally, a solute will dissolve in a solvent that has similar intermolecular forces. </p>
              <p> Organic compounds are more likely to dissolve if their functional groups are able to form similar hydrogen bonds with water molecules. </p>
              <h5> Functional Groups Present </h5>
              <dl>
                <dt> haloalkane</dt>
                <dd> low solubility in water even with dipole-dipole interaction with the water and halogen </dd>
                <dt> Aldehydes + Ketones </dt>
                <dd> The polar C=O group can form hydrogen bonds with water making the smaller molecules soluble in water </dd>
                <dt> Alcohols</dt>
                <dd> hydrogen bonding can occur between water and the polar of group making them more soluble than halides, aldehydes and ketones. </dd>
                <dt> Carboxylic acid </dt>
                <dd> Hydrogen bonding can occur between water and the polar c=O group and the polar -OH group making these molecules more soluble than alcohols </dd>
              </dl>
            <h5> Length of carbon chain </h5>
             <p> As the length increase, the non-polar region gets larger. As this non-polar tail increases it reduced the amount of hydrogen bonding that can occur between molecules and the water; thus, becoming less soluble .
             </p>

             <h4> Volatility </h4>
             <p> Describes the ease with which a liquid can evaporate </p>
             <ul>
                <li> Liquids that are highly volatile  have weak intermolecular forces holding molecules together. </li>
                <li> BP of an organic compound and volatility are directly related </li>
                <li> compounds with low BP contain weak intermolecular forces and are therefore more volatile than compounds with higher BP (strong intermolecular forces)

				<p> Lipids are used for
					<ul>
						<li> Energy storage </li>
						<li> Protection </li>
						<li> Insulation </li>
						<li> Lubrication </li>
					</ul>

				<p> There are four main types of lipids are: triglycerides, phospholipids, steroids and waxes. They all are <b> insoluble </b> in water. This is because lipids are non-polar and water is a polar molecule, making lipids hydrophobic.
				</p>

					<h4> Triglycerides </h4>
						<ul>
						<li> Fats and oils are triglycerides </li>
						<li> Made up of two types of subunit molecules: Glycerol and fatty acids. A glycerol reacting with 3 fatty acids </li>
						<li> Are esters </li>

				<p> These fatty acids can be saturated or unsaturated. Saturated fatty acids only contain a single bonds. Whereas un-saturated fatty acids contain one to several double bonds, these bonds result in kinks in the chain which affects MP of these molecules. Saturated fats are solid at room temperature, whereas oils are liquid at room temperature. </P>
				<p> Triglycerides are produced from the reaction between a glycerol molecules and three fatty acids. This is called dehydration synthesis and consequently three water molecules are produced.

				<strong class="cogverb" id="4.1.4G"> Describe and Explain: <span class="tooltiptext"> 4.1.4G:describe, using equations, the base hydrolysis (saponification) of fats (triglycerides) to produce glycerol and its long chain fatty acid salt (soap), and explain how their cleaning action and solubility in hard water is related to their chemical structure </span> </strong>
				<h4> Saponification: </h4>

					<P> Saponification (=base hydrolysis) of triglycerides involves boiling the animal fate or plant oil with excess sodium hydroxide to break the three ester linkages.
					<br> <br> this produces glycerol and three fatty acids (aka soap). Soap is produced by a <b> base hydrolysis </b> reaction between a triglyceride and <b> sodium hydroxide </b> </p>
					<P> The cleaning action of soap is based on it's chemical structure, and leads to the formation of micelle: (NOTE: THIS IS A DIRECT OBJECTIVE)
					<br> Fats have hydrophilic head, with hydrophobic tail </br>

				<h5> Micelle </h5>
					<p> When the triglyceride molecules have their hydrophilic heads out to water and fatty tails attached to dirt, they arrange in a circle called micelle. Because lipids are amphipathic, this allows them to be good cleaners because they interact with both water and dirt. Micelle allows soap to
					<img src="che photos/soap.png">
					<P> Soap molecules consist of two parts: a hydrophobic ‘tail’ consisting of fatty acids; and a hydrophilic, charged ‘head’. The grease on dirty clothes will attract the hydrophobic tails which will embed themselves in the grease particle. The hydrophilic heads will be attracted to the water and will lift the grease off the clothes and suspend it in the water as shown in the diagram.</P>
					<img src="che photos/sapo.png">

				<h5> Hard Water </h5>
				<dl>
					<dt> Soft water </dt>
						<dd> water which produces a good lather of soap is called soft water. When water falls as rain, it is naturally soft. Washing with soap is easy in soft water. </dd>
					<dt> Hard Water </dt>
						<dd> Water which does not produce good lather with soap is called hard water. It is difficult to wash soap in hard water. Water seeping through the group becomes hard water. Not useful for laundry and lab purposes. </dd>
					</dl>

				<p> Hardness of water is due to the presence of sulphates, chlorides or bicarbonate salts of metal ion Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> </p>
				<p>	This precipitate comes out in the form of 'scum' that adheres to the pipes, clothes and insides of kettles and washing machines. Soaps are sodium or potassium salts of long chain fatty acids. When soap is added to hard water the metal ions react with soap: the sodium salt present in salt are converted to corresponding calcium and magnesium salts which are precipitated as scum. This insoluble scum stick on clothes and so the cleaning capacity of soap is reduced. </p>

				<p> Building Block of proteins are amino acids. There are 20 in total. Every amino acid has an amino group (NH<sub>2</sub>) and a carboxyl group COOH. Proteins are long chain molecules (polymers) composed of amino acids (monomers)
Amino acids are covalently joined via peptide bonds
</p>

				<img src="che photos/aminoa.png">
				Different amino acids have different side chains (R) on the second carbon. This is why they are called 2-amino acids or &alpha;-amino acid as the side group is attached to the second carbon.
				</p>
				<p> Common amino acids are in formula and data booklet. 2-amino acids act differently in acidic and basic conditions.
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th> Highly acidic </th>
						<th> pH Neutral </th>
						<th> Highly Basic </th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> Amino group acts as base and accepts proton. causes a cation. </td>
						<td> Amino group acts as a base and accepts proton while the carboxyl group acts as an acid, releasing a hydrogen ion. causes Zwitterion or dipolar ion.
						</td> <td> Carboxyl groups act as an acid and donates a proton. </td>
						</tr>
				</table>

					<p> The isoelectric point of an amino acid is shown in formula and data book. Below the pH of IEP, amino acid will be a base and accept H+ to become a cation, above this pH it will be an acid and release a H+ to become an anion. Aspartic acid has a lower isoelectric point that alanine due to the carboxyl group on the side chain.
					</p>

				<h5> Formation of Proteins </h5>
					<p> Proteins are formed from amino acids. As an amino acid approaches another they meet up with a double bond O and OH for left amino, and 2 H available. In a <b> dehydration </b> reaction the double bond O (carbonyl group of the carboxylic acid) and the upper hydrogen, covalently bond, leaving the hydroxyl group and spare hydrogen to form water.
					</p>
					<img src="che photos/poly.png">

					<p> different patterns and chains formed from the polypeptide shape is due to the charge and polarity of the r chains of each amino, where some are hydrophilic and other are hydrophobic </p>
					</p>

					<h4> The four levels of Protein structure </h4>
						<p> There are four different levels of structure, primary secondary which includes alpha and beta, tertiary and quaternary.
						</p>
						<strong class="cogverb" id="4.1.4B"> Describe and Explain  <span class="tooltiptext"> 4.1.4B: describe and explain the primary, secondary (α-helix and β-pleated sheets), tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins</span> </strong>
						<h5> Primary structure </h5>
							<p>
				The order of the amino acid sequence is called the primary structure and determines the way the chain will fold. It is the sequencing of the aminos </p>
		<p> Only covalent bonds are responsible for joining the monomers together in the polymer. Linked together by -CONH<sup>-</sup> groups known as peptide links.
		</P>
						<h5> Secondary structure </h5>
							<p> <img src="che photos/secondary.png" class="left" width=20%>The secondary structure of a protein refers to the folding of the polypeptide chain as a result of hydrogen bonding forming between non-adjacent amino (-NH2) and carboxyl groups (-COOH)
						</p>


							<p> The secondary structure of a protein refers to the folding of the polypeptide chain as a result of hydrogen bonding forming between non-adjacent amino (-NH2) and carboxyl groups (-COOH)</p>
							<p> There are two types of folding:
							<br><dl><dt> <b> Alpha (&alpha;) Helices: </b></dt> <dd>occur when the amino acid sequence folds into a coil/ spiral arrangement. &alpha;-helices are <b> elastic </b> meaning the H-bonds are easily broken and allows the molecules to stretch.
							</dd><dt> <b> Beta (&beta;) pleated sheets </b> </dt><dd>occur when the amino acid sequence adopts a directionally orientated. &beta;-pleated sheets are <b> inelastic </b> which mean inter-chain H-bonding created cross links, which are stronger than intra-chain bonds and not easily broken.
							</dd></dl></p>


						<h5> Tertiary Structure </h5>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li> The overall three-dimensional configuration of the protein is referred to as the tertiary structure of the protein.
									</li> <li> The tertiary structure of a polypeptide chain will be determined by the interactions between the variable side chains
									</li> <li> These interactions may include hydrogen bonds, disulphide bridges, ionic interactions, London (dispersion) force.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<b>Note: </b>the order of amino acid sequence (primary structure) determines all subsequent levels of protein folding. </p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li> Hydrophobic sidechains tend to fold inwards to the interior of the protein molecule where they are shielded from the aqueous medium and can interact with each other.

									</li> <li>The formation of disulphide bridges is an important aspect of the stabilisation of protein tertiary structure, allowing different parts of the protein chain to be held together covalently.

									</li> <li>Hydrogen bonds may form between different side-chain groups and can bring together two parts of a chain that are some distance away in terms of sequence of amino acids.

									</li> <li>Electrostatic forces between positively and negatively charged sites on amino acid sidechains also help to stabilise the tertiary structure of a protein.
									</li> </ul>

						<h5> Quaternary Structure </h5>
							<p> Quaternary structures are found in proteins that consist of more than one polypeptide chain linked together

			<h3> &#10132; Chromatography </h3>
			<div class="super-sub-topic">
			<strong class="cogverb" id="4.1.5A"> Explain <span class="tooltiptext"> 4.1.5A: explain how proteins can be analysed by chromatography and
electrophoresis </span> </strong>
			<p> Chromatography us technique used to sperate the substance present in a mixture. Used to determine identity of substance. All methods of chromatography have a stationary phase and mobile phase. AS ink components are swept forward over the stationary phase by the solvent they under ... Rate of movement depends on:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> How strongly it absorbs onto the stationary phase </li>
				<li> How readily it dissolves in the mobile phase </li>
			</ul>

		<h4> Mobile Phase </h4>
		The liquid that transports the substance through the absorbing material travels along the stationary phase and carries substance with components in it.

		<h4> Stationary Phase </h4>
		the solid material that absorbs the mixture flowing through it.

		<dl>
			<dt> Affinity </dt>
				<dd> Components of a sample are attracted by intermolecular forces, to the mobile or stationary phase High affinity means that the component interacts strongly with the mobile or stationary phase.
				</dd>
			<dt> Absorption </dt>
				<dd> Components of the sample adsorb onto the stationary phase from the mobile phase if they are attracted to, or have an affinity for, the stationary phase.
				</dd>
			<dt> Desorption </dt>
				<dd> Components of the sample desorb off the stationary phase into the mobile phase if they are attracted to or have an affinity with the mobile phase.
				</dd>
		</dl>

		<h4> Rf Factor </h4>
		<p>	<img src="che photos/rf.png" class="left mini" width=15%>
		Rf = <sup> distance travelled by component </sup> &frasl; <sub> distance ravelled by solvent </sub> </p>
		<p> Rf = <sup> a </sup> &frasl; <sub> b </sub>
		</p>
			<p> Larger Rf values means that compound travelled faster and further because it was more attracted to the mobile phase. Less polar solvent compared to the more polar property of silica gel. No affinity to stationary phase, less polar.
		</p>




		<h4> Polarity </h4>
		<p> Water is a polar molecule, but more polar than paper. Therefore, any component of sample that has whole or partial charges, such as ionic or polar substances will have a higher affinity, or attraction, for the water mobile phase. These components move further from origin. Any component of the sample that experiences dispersion forces has a higher affinity for the stationary phase and will not move as far from the origin.

				<li> A bugger solution is added, and the proteins are washed through the column in different volumes of the resulting solution. </li>
				<li> Eluted solution is collected in small portions ( fractions). The presence of a protein in a fraction can be detected by UV spectrometer because amide and aromatic groups absorb UV light. </li>

				<strong class="cogverb" id="4.2.4A"> Appreciate <span class="tooltiptext"> 4.2.4A: appreciate that molecular manufacturing processes involve the positioning of molecules to facilitate a specific chemical reaction; such methods have the potential to synthesise specialised products, including proteins, carbon nanotubes, nanorobots and chemical sensors used in medicine.
				</span> </strong>

				<p> Molecular Manufacturing uses the idea of building structures, devices and machines from the ‘bottom up’
In the ‘bottom up’ approach the atoms or molecules in this procedure must assemble ITSELF using intrinsic forces – (intermolecular forces, covalent bonds, ionic bonds)
These intrinsic forces are a result of the chemical and
    physical properties of the atom.
They are too small for humans to manipulate.</p>

<h5> Orientation Effect </h5>
	<p> The situation where the functional groups of molecules are aligned so that a particular association (intermolecular force) and or reaction is promoted.
</p>
<p> The forced association of the functional groups of two molecules allows a collision of sufficient energy and orientation to occur that will produce a chemical reaction.
</p>

<div class="example">
<b> In molecular manufacturing, chemosynthesis (or the orientation effect) produces molecules with specific properties by:
</b>
<p> <ol type="a">
			<li> adding or substituting specific atoms in a structure.</li> <li>
		positioning desired functional groups so they align in molecules.</li> <li>
		adding a protective group that prevents functional groups from reacting.</li> <li>
		manipulating the bonding that occurs between atoms, ions and molecules.</li> <li>
		</li> </ol>
		</p>

		<p> ANSWER: B </P>
	</div> <!-- div for example of question -->


<h5> Orientation Effect of Polymers </h5>
	<p>When synthetic fibres (polymers) are spun they are oriented in only one direction to increase the strength in the tensile strength. In this way we take advantage of the strength and stiffness of carbon-carbon bonds in the backbone chain. This is evident in Kevlar.
</p>

<h5> Molecular Machines </h5>
	<p> Scientists see the potential use of molecular motor (nanomotors) in nanomachine that fit inside human cells and deliver medicine or fight cancer.
<br> <br>
When scientists aim to synthesize a molecular machine that facilitates a particular reaction, they need to devise ways that ensure the reacting species will associate with the molecule in the correct orientation.
<br> <br>
This involves positioning individual molecules close together so stronger chemical attractions can overcome weaker ones in a controlled way.
</p>

<h5> Nanorobots </h5>
	<p> <b> Nanorobots</b> are molecules that can automatically carry out nanomechanical tasks.
	</p>
	<p> Applications of Nanorobots<ul> <li>
Transport nano cargo</li> <li>
Detect and destroy cancer cells</li> <li>
Detect and remove toxins in the body</li> </ul>

<h5> Carbon Nanotubes </h5>
	<p> Carbon nanotubes have a long, hollow structure.
They are 300 times stronger than steel.
Their strength is derived from the strong carbon-carbon bonds.
They show extraordinary electrical conductivity (used as wires in miniature electrical circuits).
Can absorb more gas or impurities than activated charcoal (filters)</p>
